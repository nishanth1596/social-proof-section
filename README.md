## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me get comfortable using Tailwind CSS and leveraging its utility-first approach for styling. It also deepened my understanding of Flexbox and Grid layout techniques.

### Continued development

I would also like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid

### Useful resources

Tailwind CSS Documentation
Google Fonts - I used the League Spartan font from Google Fonts to style the text.
